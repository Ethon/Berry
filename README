Requirements to build:
   - A reasonably C++11-compliant compiler.
   - Boost version 1.42 or newer
   - CMake, I guess 2.4 or later will suffice.
   
Build instructions (Linux):
   - If not already done, get search from the git repository:
      git clone git://github.com/Ethon/Berry.git Berry
   - Change into Berry's directory:
      cd Berry
   - Create a directory for the build and change into it:
      mkdir build && cd build
   - Run CMake, optionally enable Python/Tests before:
      cmake ..
   - Compile and optionally install Berry:
      make && sudo make install
   - You're done !
